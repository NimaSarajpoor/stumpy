    "**How can we find top-1 discord of `T` in offline mode?**<br> \n",
    "To find discord, one can compute (left) matrix profile array and locate the index where the array has the maximum finite value. That is the start index of the anomaly. What `DAMP` does is to obtain an approx. left matrix profile whose maximum is exact! This means that it can still give us the correct (top-1) discord.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does DAMP work?**<br>\n",
    "Let's say we have time series `T` and we start exploring this time series from left, and now we are at index `i`. At this moment, let's say the best-so-far discord score (i.e. distance between discord and its nearest neighbor) is known to be `discord_score`. In a naive approach, one can explore all the left neighbors of the subsequence `S_i = T[i: i + m]` and find its nearest neighbor. DAMP, however, uses an early abondoning approach. So, as soon as it finds a (left) neighbor whose distance to `S_i` is less than `discord_score`, `DAMP` stop exploring the remaining of the left neighbors because the distance between `S_i` to its nearest neighbor would be also less than `discord_score`. This is called `BackwardProcessing`. To take advantage of rolling-based computation, the `BackwardProcessing` does not explore one neighbor at a time. Instead, it explores them chunk by chunk using the MASS algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can go to the next index, i.e. `i+1`, and do the same process. That means, for the next subsequence, we need to run `BackwardProcessing` at least for one chunk using MASS algorithm. But what if we can find a way to prune some the forthcoming subsequences? So, we only need to do `BackwardProcessing` for the ones that are not pruned and can be considered as eligible discords. To prune the forthcoming subsequences, we can use MASS on the query `S_i` and find its distances to the subsequences on its right. Note that for those subsequences, `S_i` is considered as one of their left neighbors! So, if the distance between `S_i` and any one of those subsequences become less than `discord_score`, those subsequences can be prunned and ignored later. So, when `DAMP` process reaches one of those subsequences, they can just be skipped."
